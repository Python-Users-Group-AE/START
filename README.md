# Getting Started

Installing basic python and the VSCode (refer to [install.md](./instructions/install.md) for installation instructions) should set up all the fundamentals to get started with your programming. The combination of two softwares should let you open and work with a myriad of file extensions including, but not limited to: Python files(`.py`), Jupyter Notebooks(`.ipynb`), Markdown(`.md`), etc

# Basics

## Virtual Environment

A Python virtual environment, often referred to as `venv`, is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python virtual environments for them. 

For more info on "when", "why" and "how" to use a virtual environement, refer to [virtual_environments.md](./instructions/virtual_environments.md)
