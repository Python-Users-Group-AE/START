# Getting Started

Installing [basic python](#installing-python) and the [VSCode](#vscode) should set up all the fundamentals to get started with your programming. The combination of two softwares should let you open and work with a myriad of file extensions including, but not limited to: Python files(`.py`), Jupyter Notebooks(`.ipynb`), Markdown(`.md`), etc

## Installing Python

1. [Download the latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) directly from python.org and run the `.exe` file.

## VSCode

1. Download VSCode from [offical source](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and run the `.exe` file.
2. Open `VSCode` after installation and navigate to the extensions menu (`View` > `Extensions`)
3. Search and install the following extensions:
   1. ms-toolsai.jupyter
